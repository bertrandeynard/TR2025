# Summary

_**TR-Langlands-Hitchin**_

_May 4-10 2025, Barcelona_

The goal of this conference is to bring together mathematicians from three distinct areas—Topological Recursion, the Langlands Program, and Hitchin systems with the moduli space of connections—that, while not yet deeply interconnected, hold promising potential for fruitful interactions. By fostering discussions and collaboration among these communities, we aim to inspire new ideas and insights that could advance each of these fields and uncover meaningful connections between them.

- Topological Recursion
 What is the common point between correlations of random matrices (in the large size limit expansion), enumerative geometry of surfaces and Calabi-Yau spaces, Taylor series expansion of KdV or KP Tau-functions, combinatorics of maps...
A common and unifying structure was discovered since 2004, and is called Topological Recursion.

 Topological Recursion can be formulated as a mathematical method, that to a Spectral Curve (a Riemann surface equipped with some additional structure, or equivalently an Airy structure) associates a family of differential forms.
 A formal Tau-function can be defined that generates all these forms.

These differential forms and the formal Tau-function enjoy many beautiful mathematical properties, they are almost modular, they satisfy special geometry deformations, Virasoro algebra, W-algebra, integrability...

Roughly speaking, Topological Recursion is an almost modular functor from the category of spectral curves to a moduli space of differential forms.

- Hitchin and moduli space of connections
Consider a base Riemann surface. The goal is to study the moduli space of pairs of principal bundle with a reductive Lie group G, and a  meromorphic connections.
It has been established that this moduli space is in bijection with the Dolbeault moduli-space of Higgs fields, and to the Betti moduli space.
There is an integrable flat connection, and this leads to the definition of a Tau-function. Many works have started studying how this Tau-function is related to the Topological Recursion.
